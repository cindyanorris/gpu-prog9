1) Suppose the THREADSPERBLOCK value was changed to be 1024.  What
would then be the largest vector that this code could scan?

2) Change this declaration in the kernel:
__shared__ int shVector[MAXSHARED - THREADSPERBLOCK];

to: 
__shared__ int shVector[MAXSHARED - THREADSPERBLOCK + 1];

Now, attempt to compile and run it.  What happens?

3) Suppose the size of the shared memory allocated to a block is
33,554,432 bytes and THREADSPERBLOCK is 512.  What would then be 
the largest vector size that this code could handle?

4) If the size of the shared memory is S in bytes and the size of the
block is B threads, what is the largest vector size that this code
can handle?
